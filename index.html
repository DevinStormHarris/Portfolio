                Hi, I'm Devin.
            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm a programmer who wants to build applications
                that simplifies all of our lives to make more room
                for the things that truly matter to us. 
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div> <!--Why do I have this purpose?-->
            <p>
                I spent a many years following this trend of over-dependence of electronics and the instant gratification it provides. <br>
                I spent the same time feeling empty and unsatisfied, as if something was missing from my life. <br>
                <br>
                That's because something WAS missing, and that was meaning. I had absolutely nothing meaningful that I was pre-occupied with.
